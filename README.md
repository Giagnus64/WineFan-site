## Languages & tools

### HTML

### JavaScript

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is used to compile newer JS down to pre ES6 convention. 

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) is used for readability and accessibility for future edits, as well as a [server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) that automatically builds and refreshes the browser upon changes.

### CSS

- [Postcss](https://postcss.org) is used for readability and accessibility for future edits with the following plugins:
    - [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) allows for bundling of multiple css files. 
    - [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is used for multi-browser support. 
    - [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested) is used to unwrap nested css.
    - [postcss-mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins) adds the ability to define and use mixins.
    - [postcss-simple-vars](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-simple-vars) allows use of Sass-like variables in css. 


### Build Tools

- [Browser-sync](https://browsersync.io) is used to test stylistic changes. Browsersync also allows multiple devices to connect to the server - used for mobile testing.
